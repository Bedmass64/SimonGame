                    My education started at SMUS in 2007 and finished in 2020. 
                    I then started learning about my passion for computers 
                    when I chose to enter my first year at Acadia University 
                    in September of 2020. 

                    Two years into my degree, in the summer of 2022, I 
                    started a project which was to learn and create my own 
                    website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and create and 
                    include a small game. I was successful in learning to 
                    and creating my website using online tutorials, resources, 
                    and previous experience from the past 2 years of my degree. 
                    I then went on to create a Simon says clone game that 
                    mimics the classic "Simon" memory game but created an 
                    online version using the pygame library in python. That 
                    code can be accessed at the link below this paragraph.
                    After creating the python version, I then decided to 
                    consult with a friend as I wanted some constructive 
                    criticism about what I should do next and what I could add 
                    to or change about the game. He mentioned that if I rewrote 
                    the game in JavaScript, I could directly implement it into 
                    the website, which is what I am currently doing as I 
                    continue my 3rd year towards my bachelor of computer 
                    science degree.
